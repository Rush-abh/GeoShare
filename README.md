# **GeoShare Project**

**Developed By:** [Rushabh Pancholi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rushabh-pancholi-62235b166/), [Atik Khatri](https://www.linkedin.com/in/atikkhatri/), [Nishant Nath](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nishant-nath-a86a61129/), [Vishal Munjani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vishal-munjani-689a21147/).


**Project Definition:** Geo Share is a system, which provides location based encryption to the existing cryptographic algorithms by adding additional layer of security that contains location and time. The layer checks the receiver’s location and it will only decrypt if the constraints matches.

**Project Scope:** This system will be used by various entities such as companies, where they will use to secure their confidential data. Cinema will use to prevent the piracy of the movies. This is not going to be the only users of this system, many organizations, Banks, Universities and Governments can invest in the system for reliability and security of the data.

**Tools Used:**
Front-End Technology : Python, Tkinter
Back-End Technology : AWS EC2, Python, MySQL, Google Maps API
Modules/Packages: PyCrypto, Socket, Tkinter, ssl, MySQL, Bcrypt, Haversine formula

**Modular Description:**
1. Registration: Users will register to the application by entering the co-ordinates of the users.
2. Applying the Encryption: After selecting the target data, encryption will be applied on the data using key and geo-lock(location and time).
3. Server Transmission: This encrypted data will be transmitted to the intended users.
4. Decryption at Specific Location: During the decryption, the server will check the receiver’s location and then only the decryption will take place.

**System Features:**
Enhanced Security: It provides better protection of data flowing across the network.
Reduced resource overhead: Increased speed and less resource usage because of efficient algorithm.
Double authentication: Geotag is checked twice for making algorithm better against spoofing.
